# test-ios

Integrate the screen below as best as you can.

- Request the data from the route : https://www.leshabitues.fr/testapi/shops
- Parse the response
- Add a loader and error handling in case the network is slow or api is down.
- You can use AFNetworking, AlamoFire, SwiftyJSON ... or any other pod you might find useful and helpful.
- Structure with a MVVM pattern
- No storyboard
- [Bonus] Add shop category filter

## Rules to follow
- Code in Swift
- You must commit regularly so we can follow your progress with an initial empty commit when you start the test
- Use the font [Lato Regular](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato) and the following colors : `#4A90E2`,`#C4C4C4`

## Deliverables

- the link to the git repository
- several commits, with an explicit message each time
- a separate file or email documenting your process and principles you've followed
